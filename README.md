## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar brings together students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC to develop software skills for science.

### Winter 2018 Open Sources Software: How to Contribute to Open Source Software Projects

We use free open source software in our data science, machine learning and scientific computing projects all the time. And free open source software exists because of the efforts of many people working collaboratively. The goal of this seminar is to gain the skills required to become contributors to the open source software projects we use everyday. *Everyone is invited!*

#### LEARNING GOALS

* To master [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
* To master [GitHub](https://github.com/) for collaborative software development
* To confidently search GitHub for projects, engage thoughtfully on the issues and make pull requests to fix issues
* To become regular contributors to open source software projects

#### SCHEDULE

Our open source software seminar meets every **Thursday 4-5pm in LSK 121**. Please join the [UBCS3 mailing list](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VCa1EYL5xjlUQ5) to receive weekly updates about the seminar.
