Colin's notes on Git
====================

Getting started
---------------

We often host git repos on either bitbucket or the [Math Dept gitlab
server](https://gitlab.math.ubc.ca).  Public code is on github.


Math dept Server
----------------

Log in with a webbrowser at https://gitlab.math.ubc.ca

This needs to be done before the person can be added to a project (I
think).


Using HTTPS
-----------

Get the "HTTPS" link from your webbrowser from the URL above.

git clone <PASTE THE LINK HERE>

for example:

git clone https://gitlab.math.ubc.ca/cbm/math405_2017.git


You can make git remember your username/password like this:

git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600000"

(this is still required in 2018!)



Using SSH keys (optional)
-------------------------

Alternatively to https, you can setup an ssh key.  Go to "profile" and
follow the instructions to add an "SSH Public key".  You'll need to do
this (I think) for each machine that you want to use to access the
repo.  Then you can use the "git://" style links.



Client Software
---------------

Linux and Mac OS X: probably just use the command line tools.

Windows: Craig Hull recommended http://www.sourcetreeapp.com.  I
haven't tried it.  Github has a client too but not sure if its
designed for interaction with github only.


Simple usage
============

Starting work, we want to get the latest changes from the server
# git fetch
# git merge origin/master
Now we do some editing.  To see our changes:
# git status
# git diff
When you're ready to add the changes to the history (e.g., finished
working on this for now, have a bug fix, etc)
# git add [filename]
This adds the file to a "staging area".  Then do
# git commit
and provide a commit message (see below for how to do this).  So far
everything local.  To push the changes to the server:
# git push origin master


Writing the commit message
--------------------------

"git commit" will open a text editor.  Unforunately, this might
default to "vi" which is confusing if you've never used it.  Type your
message (e.g., "I fixed everything, world peace achieved") and figure
out how to save and quit.  (If you have a favourite text editor, you
can use that instead by setting the "EDITOR" variable in your .bashrc
file, something like "export EDITOR=nano".)

It might be easiest when beginning to avoid this by using:

  >> git commit -m "fixed the thing and the other thing"



Looking at changes
------------------

After updating from server (git fetch, etc) I usually want to see
what has changed:
# git log
And to see exactly what the last change did:
# git diff HEAD~1
Think of that as "now minus 1" with tilde for minus (for some reason).
You can also compare two different points in history using their
SHA-256 strings (the long hexidecimal numbers)
# git diff abc123 def456


Commit some changes from a file
-------------------------------

I like to add changes by looking at the diffs, one change at a time.
I use "git add -p -i" for this and I like this workflow (I can see
exactly what I am committing).



Some notes on my personal Git workflow
======================================

These are just opinions, probably you can quickly learn more than me
and do what you like...


Don't use "git push" alone
--------------------------

When pushing, I always specify my branch explicitly:
# git push origin master
# git push origin mybranch1


Don't use "git pull", fetch instead
-----------------------------------

I like to see what is happening at each step so I rarely use "git
pull" directly.

# git fetch
# git status

Now if it says "fast-forward possible", do:

# git merge origin/master

(or "git pull"; they are the same thing in this case).

On the other hand, if "your branch and origin/master have diverged",
then a merge may not be what you want.  This usually means someone has
committed and pushed something else since you made your changes.  Its
probably fine to go ahead an do the merge.  But in some cases, you
might want to "rebase" your changes, rewriting history so your changes
happen after the other ones.

# git rebase -i origin/master

(a rebase is dangerous: here it is somewhat safe on your local branch:
you're changing the SHA numbers associated with your newests commits
but no one else is using those yet).

At any time during this, you can also use diff to see what is changed:
# git diff master origin/master

More generally, if you're on another branch it might be "foo" and
"origin/foo" instead of origin/master.


Dealing with Conflicts
======================

Sometimes, if two people modify the same place in the same file, git
cannot merge automatically and the merge will fail.  It then leaves
something like this in the file itself:

   >>>>>>>>>>
   my stuff is here
   ==========
   their change is here
   <<<<<<<<<<

You need to manually edit the file and pick your's on their's.  And
delete the `>>>>>>`, `======`, `<<<<<<` lines.  There are some tools like
"meld" that can help with this: I found them confusing; YMMV.

Then "git status", and follow the instructions, but should be:

# git add the_changed_file.txt
# git commit
# git merge origin/master

Then you *should* be "4 commits ahead of origin/master" in "git
status".  Then you can "git push origin master".

If it's more complicated, go look on Google.


Misc
----
there is a fast forward only command line option: "--ff-only", can
be helpful to avoid accidental merges.


Deleting files
--------------

Easiest is to use "git rm meh.txt" instead of deleting the file.  Then "git commit" will remove it.


Moving Files
------------

Again, easiest is "git mv meh.txt new_file.txt", then "git commit".
